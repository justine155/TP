# Enhanced Unfeasible Task Scenarios - Complete Detection System

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES** (Block Task Creation)

### 1. **Tasks Due Today - Enhanced Detection**
- **❌ Task due today exceeds daily capacity (non-one-sitting)**: "Task requires 8h but you only have 6h available today. This task isn't marked as 'one sitting' so it can't be completed."
- **❌ One-sitting task due today exceeds daily capacity**: "One-sitting task requires 10h but you only have 8h available today."
- **💡 Smart Fix**: Automatically suggests marking as "one sitting" if hours ≤ daily capacity

### 2. **Impossible Daily Workloads - Refined**
- **❌ General impossible daily workload**: "Would require 12h per day for 3 days, but you only have 8h available per day."
- **❌ Zero or negative time estimates**: "Tasks must have a positive time estimate."
- **💡 Smart Fix**: Calculates exact extension needed based on available hours

### 3. **Session Distribution Impossibilities**
- **❌ No work days until deadline**: "Deadline is in 5 days but none are configured as work days."
- **❌ Too many sessions for weekly frequency**: "Task needs 8 sessions but weekly frequency only allows 2 sessions until deadline."
- **❌ Too many sessions for 3x-week frequency**: "Task needs 10 sessions but 3x-week frequency only allows 6 sessions until deadline."

### 4. **Deadline Realism Issues**
- **❌ Deadline is in the past**: "Cannot create tasks with deadlines that have already passed."
- **❌ Deadline on non-work day**: "Deadline is on Sunday, but this isn't configured as a work day."
- **💡 Smart Fix**: Suggests next available work day

### 5. **Task Completion Impossibilities**
- **❌ Unrealistic one-sitting duration**: "12 hours is too long for a single work session. Human concentration drops significantly after 6-8 hours."
- **❌ Minimum work block exceeds daily capacity**: "Minimum work block of 600 minutes exceeds your 480 minutes of daily available time."
- **💡 Smart Fix**: Suggests removing one-sitting flag or reducing scope

## ⚠️ **MAJOR WARNINGS** (Allow with Strong Warnings)

### 6. **Intensive Schedule Warnings - Multi-Level**
- **⚠️ Extremely intensive schedule required**: "Will require 7.5h per day (94% of available time)."
- **⚠️ High intensity schedule required**: "Will require 5.6h per day (70% of available time)."
- **⚠️ Large task with very tight deadline**: "20-hour task due in 18 hours may be rushed."

### 7. **Workday Distribution Issues**
- **⚠️ Long gaps between learning sessions**: "You have 4 consecutive non-work days. Learning tasks benefit from consistent practice."
- **⚠️ Very limited work days**: "Only 2 work days per week configured. This limits scheduling flexibility."

### 8. **Task Type and Duration Mismatches**
- **⚠️ Very short sessions for complex task**: "Complex 15h task would have 45-minute sessions. This may not allow meaningful progress."
- **⚠️ Deadline conflicts with buffer preference**: "Deadline is in 2 days but you prefer 5 buffer days."

## 💡 **INFORMATIONAL ADVISORIES** (Helpful Education)

### 9. **Learning and Retention Optimization**
- **💡 Learning tasks benefit from frequency**: "Learning tasks typically benefit from more frequent, shorter sessions for better retention."
- **💡 Category-specific advice**: "Writing projects frequently require more time than initially estimated for research, drafts, and revisions."

### 10. **Pattern Recognition and Education**
- **💡 Estimation significantly higher than usual**: "This estimate (25h) is much higher than your typical tasks (8h average)."
- **💡 Very short task**: "Tasks under 30 minutes might be better handled as quick actions rather than scheduled study sessions."

## 🎯 **Smart Suggestions System - Enhanced**

### Automatic Fixes Available
1. **Frequency Adjustments**
   - Weekly → 3x-week → Daily (progressive escalation)
   - Intelligently calculates minimum required frequency

2. **Intelligent Deadline Extensions**
   - **Tasks due today**: Suggests 3-7 days based on workload
   - **Impossible workloads**: Calculates exact days needed
   - **Buffer respect**: Adds user's preferred buffer time
   - **Work day alignment**: Suggests deadlines on work days

3. **Task Configuration Optimizations**
   - **Mark as one-sitting**: For tasks due today that fit daily capacity
   - **Remove one-sitting**: For unrealistically long sessions
   - **Estimation refinements**: Break down large tasks or increase small ones

4. **Settings Suggestions**
   - **Increase daily hours**: For impossible workloads (with warning)
   - **Adjust work days**: For deadline conflicts

## 📊 **Real-World Examples - Enhanced**

### Example 1: Task Due Today (Your Specific Case)
```
Input: "Finish presentation - 10 hours, due today, daily frequency"
With 8h daily capacity, not marked as one-sitting

❌ CRITICAL: "Task due today exceeds daily capacity"
→ "Task requires 10h but you only have 8h available today. 
   This task isn't marked as 'one sitting' so it can't be completed."

💡 Smart Suggestions:
→ [Apply] Extend deadline to tomorrow
→ [Apply] Reduce scope to 8 hours
→ [Apply] Increase daily hours to 10h (requires settings change)

BUTTON: "Resolve Critical Issues First" (disabled, red)
```

### Example 2: Impossible Weekly Frequency
```
Input: "Study calculus - 20 hours, weekly frequency, due in 10 days"

❌ CRITICAL: "Too many sessions for weekly frequency"
→ "Task needs 5 sessions but weekly frequency only allows 1 session until deadline."

💡 Smart Suggestions:
→ [Apply] Change frequency to "3x per week"
→ [Apply] Extend deadline to 4 weeks
→ [Apply All Suggestions]
```

### Example 3: Learning Task with Poor Rhythm
```
Input: "Learn Spanish - 30 hours, weekly frequency, due in 6 weeks"

💡 INFO: "Learning tasks benefit from frequency"
→ "Learning tasks typically benefit from more frequent, shorter sessions for better retention."

💡 Smart Suggestions:
→ [Apply] Change to "3x per week" frequency
→ Keep sessions to 2-3 hours each for optimal learning
```

### Example 4: Deadline on Weekend
```
Input: "Submit report - 5 hours, due Sunday"
With work days: Mon-Fri

❌ CRITICAL: "Deadline on non-work day"
→ "Deadline is on Sunday, but this isn't configured as a work day."

💡 Smart Suggestions:
→ [Apply] Move deadline to Monday
→ [Apply] Add Sunday to work days
```
