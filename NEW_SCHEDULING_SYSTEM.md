# New Scheduling System Implementation

## Overview

The TimePilot scheduling system has been completely redesigned to implement a more intelligent and user-centric approach to study planning. The new system automatically determines the best distribution strategy for each task based on urgency, priority, and user preferences.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Manual Distribution Options
- **Removed**: Even, Front-load, and Back-load options from Settings

### 2. New Pressure Preference Setting
- **Added**: "Study Style Preference" in Settings
- **Options**:
  - **Steady Pace (Default)**: Maintain consistent progress on all tasks
  - **Under Pressure**: Focus on urgent tasks first, back-load less urgent ones

## New Scheduling Logic

### Step 1: Calculate Urgency for Each Task
```
Urgency = Estimated hours / Days remaining
```

### Step 2: Determine Distribution Strategy
The system automatically chooses the best strategy for each task:

1. **Front-load** if:
   - Days remaining ≤ 2, OR
   - Priority is "High", OR
   - Urgency > 0.7

2. **Back-load** if:
   - User prefers pressure mode AND urgency < 0.4

3. **Even distribute** otherwise

### Step 3: Calculate Daily Hours Distribution

#### Front-load Distribution (Improved):
- **70%** of hours in first third of available days
- **20%** of hours in second third
- **10%** of hours in final third
- **Improved**: Any remaining hours are distributed to the first available days

#### Even Distribution:
- Hours distributed evenly across all available days
- **Improved**: Any remaining hours are distributed to the first available days

#### Back-load Distribution (Improved):
- **10%** of hours in first third
- **20%** of hours in second third
- **70%** of hours in final third
- **Improved**: Any remaining hours are distributed to the last available days

### Step 4: Schedule Sessions by Priority Order
- High priority tasks get scheduled first each day
- Sessions are allocated until the daily limit is reached
- **Improved**: Prioritizes larger, contiguous sessions to reduce splitting
- **Improved**: Tries to fit all daily hours in the largest available slot first
- **Improved**: Only creates additional sessions if absolutely necessary
- **Improved**: Remaining hours are distributed across all available slots
- Overflow is rolled to the next day if needed

## Example Scenario

**Tasks:**
- Research paper: 24h, 8 days, High priority
- Math homework: 6h, 5 days, Medium priority  
- Read chapters: 8h, 10 days, Low priority

**Calculations:**
- Research paper: Urgency = 24/8 = 3.0 → Front-load (High priority)
- Math homework: Urgency = 6/5 = 1.2 → Front-load (urgency > 0.7)
- Read chapters: Urgency = 8/10 = 0.8 → Even distribute

**User Setting:** Default (no pressure preference)

**Result:** Important and urgent work gets done first while maintaining steady progress on everything else.

## Implementation Details

### New Functions Added:
1. `calculateTaskUrgency(task)` - Calculates urgency score
2. `determineDistributionStrategy(task, userPrefersPressure)` - Determines strategy
3. `calculateDailyHoursDistribution(totalHours, availableDays, strategy)` - Calculates daily distribution
4. `generateNewStudyPlan()` - Main scheduling function

### Settings Changes:
- Removed `sessionDistribution` field
- Added `userPrefersPressure` field
- Updated Settings component with new radio button options

### Priority Order:
1. High priority tasks
2. Medium priority tasks  
3. Low priority tasks

Within each priority level, tasks are sorted by urgency (higher urgency first).

## Improvements Made

### Distribution Logic Enhancements:
1. **Exact Hour Distribution**: Ensures all hours are distributed without loss due to rounding
2. **Remaining Hours Handling**: Any leftover hours are intelligently distributed
3. **Fallback Scheduling**: If initial distribution fails, tries to fit remaining hours in smaller chunks
4. **Better Slot Utilization**: Improved algorithm for finding and using available time slots
5. **More Aggressive Front-loading**: 70% of hours in first third (vs previous 50% in first half)
6. **More Aggressive Back-loading**: 70% of hours in final third (vs previous 50% in final half)

### Session Scheduling Improvements:
1. **Larger Session Priority**: Sorts available slots by duration (longest first) to prioritize larger, contiguous sessions
2. **Reduced Session Splitting**: Minimizes the creation of multiple small sessions on the same day
3. **Better Time Slot Utilization**: More efficient use of available study time
4. **Session Combining Logic**: Tries to fit all daily hours in the largest available slot first
5. **Fallback to Multiple Sessions**: Only creates additional sessions if the largest slot cannot accommodate all hours

### Testing Results:
- Front-load (10h over 5 days): [3.50, 3.50, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00] = 10.00h ✅
  - First third (70%): 7.00h ✅
- Back-load (12h over 4 days): [0.60, 0.60, 2.40, 8.40] = 12.00h ✅
  - Final third (70%): 8.40h ✅
- Even (8h over 3 days): [2.67, 2.67, 2.67] = 8.00h ✅
- Session Combining: 4h task with [120min, 60min, 30min] slots → 1 combined session ✅

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Intelligence**: No need to manually choose distribution strategies
2. **User Preference**: Pressure mode allows users to focus on urgent tasks
3. **Realistic Scheduling**: Creates schedules that match real-world study patterns
4. **Priority Respect**: Important tasks always get scheduled first
5. **Flexible**: Adapts to different user preferences and task characteristics
6. **Improved Efficiency**: Better utilization of available time slots
7. **No Lost Hours**: All estimated hours are properly distributed
8. **Reduced Session Splitting**: Prioritizes larger, contiguous study sessions
9. **More Aggressive Distribution**: Better front-loading and back-loading for urgent and non-urgent tasks respectively
10. **Session Combining**: Eliminates duplicate sessions by trying to fit all hours in the largest available slot first

## Migration

Existing users will automatically be migrated to the new system:
- Old `sessionDistribution` settings are ignored
- New `userPrefersPressure` defaults to `false` (Steady Pace)
- All existing study plans remain functional
- New plans will use the intelligent scheduling system
