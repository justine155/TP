# Drag and Drop Precision Improvements

## Problem Description
Users reported that the drag and drop feature was inconsistent with dropping. When dragging a session to a specific time, it would randomly drop somewhere near the intended location instead of exactly where the user intended.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `findNearestAvailableSlot` function in `CalendarView.tsx`. The original implementation had several problems:

1. **Grid Snapping**: The system was rounding the drop time to buffer intervals (15+ minutes) instead of precise placement
2. **Search Algorithm**: It searched in both directions from a rounded target, often finding slots farther from the intended location
3. **Inconsistent Grid**: The snapping didn't match the calendar's visual grid intervals

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Time Snapping Logic
```typescript
// OLD: Snapped to buffer intervals (often 15+ minutes)
const bufferMinutes = Math.max(settings.bufferTimeBetweenSessions || 15, 5);
const gridSize = bufferMinutes * 60 * 1000;

// NEW: Snaps to user's selected time interval (5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes)
const SNAP_INTERVAL = timeInterval * 60 * 1000;
```

### 2. Precise Placement Strategy
- **First Priority**: Try to place at the exact target location (snapped to grid)
- **Fallback**: Search for nearest available slot in smaller increments
- **Consistent Grid**: Uses the same time intervals as the calendar display

### 3. Micro-Movement Detection
Added tolerance for micro-movements to prevent accidental tiny shifts:
```typescript
// If movement is less than 5 minutes, ignore it
if (timeDifferenceFromOriginal < 5) {
  setDragFeedback('Session returned to original position (micro-movement ignored)');
  return;
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows what's happening during drag
- **Precise notifications**: Tells users exactly where the session was placed
- **Color-coded messages**: Different colors for different outcomes
- **Visual improvements**: Better drag preview and drop zone indicators

### 5. Improved Search Algorithm
- **Reduced search range**: From 12 hours to 6 hours for faster results
- **Forward priority**: Prefers later times when multiple options exist
- **Grid consistency**: All placements align with the calendar's visual grid

## Key Changes Made

### In `findNearestAvailableSlot` function:
1. Changed snapping from buffer intervals to user's time interval
2. Improved search algorithm to prioritize exact placement
3. Reduced search range for better performance

### In `handleEventDrop` function:
1. Added micro-movement detection
2. Enhanced feedback messages with emojis and specific timing
3. Better error handling and user communication

### Visual Improvements:
1. Enhanced drag preview styling
2. Better drop zone indicators
3. Improved feedback notification styling
4. Added hover effects for draggable elements

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Precise Placement
- Sessions snap to the calendar's visible grid intervals
- Placement matches the user's selected time interval (5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes)
- Exact target placement when possible

### Smart Fallback
- When exact placement isn't available, finds the nearest valid slot
- Informs users about any adjustments made
- Prioritizes forward movement (later times) over backward

### User Feedback
- ✅ Green message: Exact placement achieved
- 📍 Blue message: Close placement (within 15 minutes)
- 🔄 Orange message: Moved to nearest available slot
- ❌ Red message: Cannot place (no available slots)

### Micro-Movement Tolerance
- Ignores movements smaller than 5 minutes
- Prevents accidental tiny shifts from imprecise mouse movements

## Testing Instructions

1. **Set different time intervals** (5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes) in the calendar toolbar
2. **Drag sessions** to various time slots and verify they snap to the correct grid
3. **Try exact placement** - sessions should place exactly where dropped when possible
4. **Test near-misses** - when exact placement isn't available, check that the nearest slot is found
5. **Check feedback messages** - verify that users get clear information about placement
6. **Test micro-movements** - small drags (< 5 minutes) should be ignored
